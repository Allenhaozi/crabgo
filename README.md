### overview
crab-go is a very simple go restful web framework   

crab-go is based on [echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo)   

The inspiration comes from my previous PHP framework [crab](https://github.com/allenhaozi/crab)

It also contains thoughts on a typical Web Restful interface architecture,   

We can also incorporate some accumulated experience into this framework, and abstract out reusable capabilities.   

Avoid building wheels repeatedly
